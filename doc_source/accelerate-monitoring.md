You can use the `logs` and `traces` commands to monitor your serverless application\.

**Topics**

+ [sam traces](#accelerate-traces)

## sam logs<a name="accelerate-logs"></a>

Fetches logs that are generated by your serverless application\. Supported resources include AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway REST APIs, API Gateway HTTP APIs, and Step Functions state machines\. The following parameters are new or changed from the existing [sam logs](sam-cli-command-reference-sam-logs.md) command\.

**Usage:**

```
sam logs [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

The following resource types are supported: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/accelerate-monitoring.html)  | 
| \-\-tail |  Tails the log output\. This ignores the end time argument and continues to display logs as they become available\. If you don't specify the `name` or `cw-log-group` options, the output includes all logs for your application\.  | 
| \-\-include\-traces |  Includes X\-Ray traces in the log output\.  | 
| \-\-output TEXT | Specifies the output format for logs\. To print formatted logs, specify `text`\. To print the logs as JSON, specify `json`\. |

```
sam logs --stack-name sam-app --cw-log-groups /aws/lambda/myfunction-123 --cw-log-groups /aws/lambda/myfunction-456
```

## sam traces<a name="accelerate-traces"></a>
